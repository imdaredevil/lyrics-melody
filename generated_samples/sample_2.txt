holly leaves and christmas trees by elvis presley
s,  elvis presley

Who am,  of christmas

I can't buy a thing if, 
The only thing called
In the world asa walk in the world
Who will be heard

If I asked her the name of the world

The day of the day
vis far behind
Full of the evening
And the world will fall
Will she hear me receive


A thrill that all I can see
A face in her ev'rything going by
That her face

Who'd ask her face
And I,  to my words
Will hear her wolf survival

Will you hear mee
Black angel
Will you hear mee
