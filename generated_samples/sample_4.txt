So I must stay

My only in your way
So much in the
Can you see
 much in the way
Oh my eyes
I'll sing anything
count on your days
 wished that was
doing something
But I'm just between us
I'll be on a job
You'll be on the bed
But I'm losing weight
Yes anything
everything's good
losing all about being
But it don't belong

like ahh
Can you hear me
If you don't come back to me

everything's breaking up
I just plan
And I make a little job
But don't
to try to be
I'm adoing wrong to the day
But losing so in the end
I try to day
But it's a little
and I'll be in a way
And in the way
And I'm losing
everything's
My life's over
I'll be kind of again
And suddenly came here

And from the end
And it doesn't come back in a day
But
everything
Are you don't come on
In a day

And you know it's plain to
So I'll win this gladly
